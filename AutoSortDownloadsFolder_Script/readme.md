# 🗂️ Downloads Folder Auto Organizer

A lightweight executable that automatically organizes your **Downloads** folder by sorting files into categorized subfolders based on file types — no need to install Python.

---

## ✅ Features

- 📁 Auto-creates subfolders (Images, Documents, Fonts, etc.)
- 🔍 Detects file types using extensions
- 🧠 Skips already-organized files
- 🛠️ No installation required — just run the `.exe`

---

## 📂 How It Works

The executable checks your Downloads folder and moves files into the following categories:

| Category     | File Extensions |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Images**       | `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.svg`, `.webp`, etc. |
| **Documents**    | `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.ppt`, `.txt`, `.csv`, etc. |
| **Fonts**        | `.ttf`, `.otf`, `.woff`, etc. |
| **Videos**       | `.mp4`, `.mkv`, `.mov`, etc. |
| **Audio**        | `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.flac`, etc. |
| **Archives**     | `.zip`, `.rar`, `.7z`, `.tar`, `.gz` |
| **Code Files**   | `.py`, `.js`, `.html`, `.cpp`, etc. |
| **Executables**  | `.exe`, `.msi`, `.bat`, etc. |
| **Installers**   | `.iso`, `.img`, `.dmg` |
| **Others**       | Everything else not matched above |

## 🚀 How to Use

1. 📥 Download the executable:
   - `organize_files_in_downloads.exe`

3. ▶️ **Double-click to run**

## ⏱️ Optional: Automate It

To have it run automatically:

- **Windows Task Scheduler**:
  - Schedule the EXE to run at login, or every hour/day.

## 🧾 Notes

- 📌 Only files are moved — folders are ignored
- 🚫 Duplicate files will not be overwritten
- 🧹 You can delete the EXE after running if needed — changes are permanent
